Wallarm estimates the risk for each API threat based on [security control](#wallarm-security-controls) status and discovered vulnerabilities:

* **Red** - it happens if there are no security controls applied or your APIs have active high risk vulnerabilities.
* **Yellow** - it happens if security controls are only partially applied or your APIs have active medium risk vulnerabilities.
* **Green** indicates that your APIs are low vulnerable to that threat and all security controls are applied.

For each OWASP API Top 10 threat you can find detailed info about the threat, available security controls, corresponding vulnerabilities, and investigate related attacks:
