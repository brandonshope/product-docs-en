1. Create an account in Wallarm Console using the link for the [EU](https://my.wallarm.com/signup) or [US](https://us1.my.wallarm.com/signup) Wallarm Cloud.

    [More details on Wallarm Clouds →][wallarm-cloud-docs]
1. Open Wallarm Console → **Nodes** → **CDN** → **Create node**.
1. Input the domain address to be protected, e.g. `example.com`.

    The specified address must not contain the scheme and slashes.
1. Make sure Wallarm correctly identified the IP address associated with the specified domain. Otherwise, please change the automatically discovered origin IP.

    !!! warning "Dynamic update of origin IP addresses"
        If your hosting provider dynamically updates the IP address associated with the protected domain, please keep the origin IP address specified in the CDN node configuration up to date. Wallarm Console enables you to [change the origin IP address][update-origin-ip-docs] at any time.

        Otherwise, the CDN node will try to proxy requests to incorrect IP address that may cause the node service downtime.
1. Wait for the CDN node registration to finish.

    Once the CDN node registration is finished, the CDN node status will be changed to **Requires CNAME**.
1. Add the CNAME record generated by Wallarm to the DNS records of the protected domain.

    If the CNAME record is already configured for the domain, please replace its value with the one generated by Wallarm.

    ![!CDN node creation modal][cname-required-modal]

    Depending on your DNS provider, changes to DNS records can take up to 24 hours to propagate and take effect for the Internet. Once the new CNAME record is propagated, the Wallarm CDN node will start blocking malicious traffic.
1. If required, upload the custom SSL/TLS certificate.

    Wallarm will generate the Let's Encrypt certificate for the CDN node domain by default.
1. Once DNS record changes propagated, send test attack to the protected domain:

    ```bash
    curl http://<PROTECTED_DOMAIN>/?id='or+1=1--a-<script>prompt(1)</script>'
    ```
    
    * The request will be blocked by the Wallarm CDN node (the HTTP response code is 403).
    * The blocked request data will be displayed in Wallarm Console → **Events**, e.g.:
