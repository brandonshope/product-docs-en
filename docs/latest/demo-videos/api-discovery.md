# API Discovery overview

The [API Discovery](../about-wallarm/api-discovery.md) module of the Wallarm platform builds your application REST API inventory based on the actual API usage. The module continuously analyzes the real traffic requests and builds the API inventory based on the analysis results.

Watch our demo video to get familiar with: 

* How API Discovery presents a discovered API inventory.
* How to filter endpoints and which data is presented for each of them.
* How to quickly create rules for the selected endpoints.
* How to view endpoint related events.
