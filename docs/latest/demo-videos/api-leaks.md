# API Leaks overview

The [API Leaks](../about-wallarm/api-leaks.md) module of the Wallarm platform actively scans thousands of public repositories and sources to check for the leaks of API tokens and allow you to block leaked credentials usage by means of the deployed Wallarm node(s). 

Watch our demo video to:

* Get familiar with user interface.
* Understand what leak sources are and how they are represented.
* Overview the principles of dynamic risk scoring.
* Understand virtual patch rule as a remediation for discovered leak.
* Know leak lifecycle transitions (opening, closing, marking as false).
