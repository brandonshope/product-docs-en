# Installation of the filtering node from DEB or RPM packages on Yandex.Cloud

This quick guide provides the steps to install the filtering node from the source packages on a separate Yandex Compute Cloud instance. By following this guide, you will create an instance from the supported operating system image and install the Wallarm filtering node on this operating system.

!!! warning "The instructions limitations"
    These instructions do not cover the configuration of load balancing and node autoscaling. If setting up these components yourself, we recommend that you review the [instructions on Yandex Network Load Balancer](https://cloud.yandex.com/en/docs/network-load-balancer/).

## Requirements

* Access to the [Yandex.Cloud management console](https://console.cloud.yandex.com/)
* Payment account in the `ACTIVE` or `TRIAL_ACTIVE` status displayed on the [billing page](https://console.cloud.yandex.com/billing)
* Folder created. By default, the folder `default` will be created. To create a new folder, please follow these [instructions](https://cloud.yandex.com/docs/resource-manager/operations/folder/create)
* Access to the account with the **Administrator** or **Deploy** role and twoâ€‘factor authentication disabled in Wallarm Console for the [EU Cloud](https://my.wallarm.com/) or [US Cloud](https://us1.my.wallarm.com/)

## Filtering node installation options

Since the filtering node operates as the web server or API gateway module, web server or API gateway packages should be installed on the operating system along with the filtering node packages.

You can select the web server or API gateway that is the most suitable for your application architecture from the following list:
