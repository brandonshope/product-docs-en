# API Abuse Prevention profile management <a href="../../subscription-plans/#subscription-plans"><img src="../../images/api-security-tag.svg" style="border: none;"></a>

In the **API Abuse Prevention** section of Wallarm Console you can manage API abuse profiles that are required for configuration of the [**API Abuse Prevention**](../about-wallarm/api-abuse-prevention.md) module.

The section is only available to the users of the following [roles](../user-guides/settings/users.md#user-roles):

* **Administrator** or **Analyst** for the regular accounts.
* **Global Administrator** or **Global Analyst** for the accounts with the multitenancy feature.

## Creating API abuse profile

To create an API abuse profile:

1. In Wallarm Console → **API Abuse Prevention**, click **Create profile**.
1. Select applications to protect.
1. Select [accuracy](../about-wallarm/api-abuse-prevention.md#accuracy) of protection.
1. If necessary, in the **Protect from** section, limit the [types of bots](../about-wallarm/api-abuse-prevention.md#automated-threats-blocked-by-api-abuse-prevention) to protect from.
1. Select to [add bots in denylist or graylist](../about-wallarm/api-abuse-prevention.md#reaction-to-malicious-bots).
1. Set name and optionally description.

    Once the API abuse profile is configured, the module will start the [traffic analysis and blocking supported automated threats](../about-wallarm/api-abuse-prevention.md#how-api-abuse-prevention-works).

## Disabling API abuse profile

Disabled profiles are the ones that the **API Abuse Prevention** module does not use during traffic analysis but that are still displayed in the profile list. You can re-enable disabled profiles at any moment. If there are no enabled profiles, the module does not block malicious bots.

You can disable the profile by using the corresponding **Disable** option.

## Deleting API abuse profile

Deleted profiles are the ones that cannot be restored and that the **API Abuse Prevention** module does not use during traffic analysis.

You can delete the profile by using the corresponding **Delete** option.

## Exploring blocked malicious bots and their attacks

The **API Abuse Prevention** module blocks bots by adding them to the [denylist](../user-guides/ip-lists/denylist.md) or [graylist](../user-guides/ip-lists/graylist.md) for 1 hour.

You can explore blocked bot's IPs in Wallarm Console → **IP lists** → **Denylist** or **Graylist**. Explore IPs added with the `Bot` **Reason**.

![!Denylisted bot IPs](../images/about-wallarm-waf/abi-abuse-prevention/denylisted-bot-ips.png)

If denylisted or graylisted IP actually does not belong to a malicious bot, you can either delete the IP from the list or [allowlist](../user-guides/ip-lists/allowlist.md) it. Wallarm does not block any requests originating from allowlisted IPs including malicious ones.

You can also explore bot API abuse attacks performed by bots in Wallarm Console → **Events** section. Use `api_abuse` search key or select `API Abuse` from the **Type** filter.

![!API Abuse events](../images/about-wallarm-waf/abi-abuse-prevention/api-abuse-events.png)

The **API Abuse Prevention** module compiles client traffic into URL patterns. The URL pattern may have the following segments:

| Segment | Contains | Example |
|---|---|---|
| SENSITIVE | Sensitive data that refers to the internals of the web application. | `wp-admin` |
| IDENTIFIER | Various identifiers like numeric identifiers, UUIDs, etc. | - |
| STATIC | Static data. | images, js |
| FILE | Non-interactive files. | `image.png` |
| QUERY | Query parameters. | - |
| AUTH | Content related to the authentication/authorization endpoints. | - |
| LANGUAGE | Language-related segments. | `en`, `fr` |
| HEALTHCHECK | Content related to the health check endpoints. | - |
| VARY | Other data not important for analysis. | - |
