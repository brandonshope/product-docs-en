# Allocating Resources for Wallarm Node

The amount of memory and CPU resources allocated for the filtering node determines the quality and speed of request processing. These instructions describe the recommendations for filtering node memory allocation.

In a filtering node there are two main memory and CPU consumers:

* [Tarantool](#tarantool), also called **postanalytics module**. This is the local data analytics backend and the primary memory consumer in a filtering node.
* [NGINX](#nginx) is the main filtering node and reverse proxy component.

### Allocating Resources in Other Deployment Options

The sizing of Tarantool memory is controlled using the `SLAB_ALLOC_ARENA` attribute in the `/etc/default/wallarm-tarantool` configuration file. To allocate memory:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart wallarm-tarantool
    ```

    ```bash
    sudo service wallarm-tarantool restart
    ```

    ```bash

    ```
=== "CentOS 7.x"
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart wallarm-tarantool
    ```

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart wallarm-tarantool
    ```

To learn how long a Tarantool instance is capable of keeping traffic details with the current level of filtering node load, you can use the [`wallarm-tarantool/gauge-timeframe_size`](../monitoring/available-metrics.md#time-of-storing-requests-in-the-postanalytics-module-in-seconds) monitoring metric.

## NGINX

NGINX memory consumption depends on many factors. On average it can be estimated as the following:

```
Number of concurrent request * Average request size * 3
```

For example:

* Filtering node is processing at peak 10000 concurrent requests,
* average request size is 5 kB.

The NGINX memory consumption can be estimated as follows:

```
10000 * 5 kB * 3 = 150000 kB (or ~150 MB)
```

**To allocate the amount of memory:**

* for the NGINX Ingress controller pod (`ingress-controller`), configure the following sections in the `values.yaml` file by using the `--set` option of `helm install` or `helm upgrade`:
    ```
    controller:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: 1000m
          memory: 1640Mi
        requests:
          cpu: 1000m
          memory: 1640Mi
    ```

    Example of commands changing the parameters:

    === "Ingress controller installation"
        ```bash
        helm install --set controller.resources.limits.cpu='2000m',controller.resources.limits.memory='3280Mi' <INGRESS_CONTROLLER_RELEASE_NAME> wallarm/wallarm-ingress -n <KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE>
        ```

        There are also [other parameters](../configure-kubernetes-en.md#additional-settings-for-helm-chart) required for correct Ingress controller installation. Please pass them in the `--set` option too.
    === "Updating Ingress controller parameters"
        ```bash
        helm upgrade --reuse-values --set controller.resources.limits.cpu='2000m',controller.resources.limits.memory='3280Mi' <INGRESS_CONTROLLER_RELEASE_NAME> wallarm/wallarm-ingress -n <KUBERNETES_NAMESPACE>
        ```

* for other deployment options, use the NGINX configuration files.

!!! info "Recommendations from the CPU utilization perspective"
    When running in production mode, it is recommended to allocate at least one CPU core for the NGINX process and one core for the Tarantool process.
    
    Actual NGINX CPU utilization depends on many factors like RPS level, average size of request and response, number of LOM rules handled by the node, types and layers of employed data encodings like Base64 or data compression, etc. On average, one CPU core can handle about 500 RPS. In the majority of cases it is recommended to initially over-provision a filtering node, see the actual CPU and memory usage for real production traffic levels, and gradually reduce allocated resources to a reasonable level (with at least 2x headroom for traffic spikes and node redundancy).

## Best practices for lowering CPU load

You can do the following to lower the CPU load by Wallarm:

* [Enable extended logging](../../admin-en/configure-logging.md#configuring-extended-logging-for-the-nginxâ€‘based-filter-node) and monitor processing time to reveal the longest request processing episodes.
* Add `limit_req` to the NGINX configuration. This may be the best way to reduce CPU load in case of brute force and other attacks.

    ??? info "Example configuration" - using `limit_req`"

        ```bash
        http {
            map $request_uri $binary_remote_addr_map {
            ~^/get $binary_remote_addr;
            ~^/post $binary_remote_addr;
            ~^/wp-login.php $binary_remote_addr;
            }
            limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr_map zone=urls:10m rate=3r/s;
            limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr$request_uri zone=allurl:10m rate=5r/s;
                        
            limit_req_status 444;

            server {
                location {
                limit_req zone=urls nodelay;
                limit_req zone=allurl burst=30;
                }
              }
            }
        ```

* Set the [`wallarm_acl_access_phase`](../../admin-en/configure-parameters-en.md#wallarm_acl_access_phase) directive to `on` to immediately block any requests from denylisted IPs in any filtration mode without searching for the attack signs in these requests.

    Note that this method of lowering CPU usage may lead to skipping requests from search engines. This problem, however, can also be solved through the use of the `map` module in the NGINX configuration.

    ??? info "Example configuration - `map` module solving search engines problem"

        ```bash
        http {
        wallarm_acl_access_phase on;
        map $http_user_agent $wallarm_mode{
            default monitoring;
            ~*(google|bing|yandex|msnbot) off;
        }
        server {
            server_name mos.ru;
            wallarm_mode $wallarm_mode;
        }
        }
        ```

* Disable [libdetection](../../about-wallarm/protecting-against-attacks.md#libdetection-overview) (enabled by default since node version 4.4) via `wallarm_enable_libdetection off`. Using libdetection increases CPU consumption by 5-10%.
* Disable mistakenly applied parsers [in rules](../../user-guides/rules/disable-request-parsers.md) or [via the NGINX configuration](../../admin-en/configure-parameters-en.md#wallarm_parser_disable) for specific elements of the requests.
* [Lower request processing time](../../user-guides/rules/configure-overlimit-res-detection.md) where data is loaded that does not imply the possibility of an attack.
* Analyze possible targets for [DDoS](../../attacks-vulns-list.md#ddos-distributed-denial-of-service-attack) and [turn on blocking triggers against brute force](../../admin-en/configuration-guides/protecting-against-bruteforce.md) and DirBuster apps.
* Check Wallarm [IP lists](../../user-guides/ip-lists/overview.md) to find IPs that were mistakenly added to the **Allowlist** or locations mistakenly not added to the **Denylist**.

A CPU load about 10-15% would be the ideal result , meaning that Wallarm nodes will be able to handle a x10 traffic spike.
