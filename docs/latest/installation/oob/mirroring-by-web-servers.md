# Deploying Wallarm to analyze traffic mirrored by a web server

This article demonstrates examples on how to configure your web server to mirror incoming traffic to Wallarm nodes as to an additional backend ...

Mirrored traffic analysis is supported only by the NGINX-based Wallarm nodes.

## NGINX

Starting with NGINX 1.13 you can mirror the traffic to an additional backend. For NGINX to mirror the traffic:

1. Configure the [`ngx_http_mirror_module`](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_mirror_module.html) module by setting the `mirror` directive in the `location` or `server` block.

    The example below will mirror requests received at `location /` to `location /mirror-test`.
1. To send the mirrored traffic to the Wallarm node, list the headers to be mirrored and specify the IP address of the machine with the node in the `location` the `mirror` directive points.

```
location / {
        mirror /mirror-test;
        mirror_request_body on;
        root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
        index  index.html index.htm; 
    }
    
location /mirror-test {
        internal;
        #proxy_pass http://111.11.111.1$request_uri;
        proxy_pass http://222.222.222.222$request_uri;
        proxy_set_header X-SERVER-PORT $server_port;
        proxy_set_header X-SERVER-ADDR $server_addr;
        proxy_set_header HOST $http_host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $realip_remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Port $realip_remote_port;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $http_x_forwarded_proto;
        proxy_set_header X-Scheme $scheme;
        proxy_set_header X-Request-ID $request_id;
    }
```

## Envoy

This example configures traffic mirroring with Envoy via the single `listener` listening to port 80 (without TLS) and having a single `filter`. Addresses of an original backend and additional backend receiving mirrored traffic are specified in the `clusters` block.

```yaml
static_resources:
  listeners:
  - address:
      socket_address:
        address: 0.0.0.0
        port_value: 80
    filter_chains:
    - filters:
        - name: envoy.filters.network.http_connection_manager
          typed_config:
            "@type": type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager
            stat_prefix: ingress_http
            codec_type: AUTO
            route_config:
              name: local_route
              virtual_hosts:
              - name: backend
                domains:
                - "*"
                routes:
                - match:
                    prefix: "/"
                  route:
                    cluster: httpbin     # <-- link to the original cluster
                    request_mirror_policies:
                    - cluster: wallarm   # <-- link to the cluster receiving mirrored requests
                      runtime_fraction:
                        default_value:
                          numerator: 100
            http_filters:
            - name: envoy.filters.http.router
              typed_config:
                "@type": type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.filters.http.router.v3.Router

              ### mirror schema can be deployed with any port but the
              ### default value is TCP/8445.
              ###
              socket_address:
                address: wallarm
                port_value: 8445
```

## Istio

For Istio to mirror the traffic, you can configure `VirtualService` for mirroring routes either to the internal endpoint (internal for Istio, e.g. hosted in Kubernetes) or to the external endpoint with `ServiceEntry`:

* To enable mirroring of in-cluster requests (e.g. between pods), add `mesh` to `.spec.gateways`.
* To enable mirroring of external requests (e.g. via LoadBalancer or NodePort service), configure the Istio `Gateway` component and add the name of the component to `.spec.gateways` of `VirtualService`. This option is presented in the example below.

```yaml
---
### Configuration of destination for mirrored traffic
###
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: ServiceEntry
metadata:
  name: wallarm-external-svc
spec:
  hosts:
    - some.external.service.tld # mirroring destination address
  location: MESH_EXTERNAL
  ports:
    - number: 8445 # mirroring destination port
      name: http
      protocol: HTTP
  resolution: DNS
---
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: httpbin
spec:
  hosts:
    - ...
  gateways:
    ### Name of istio `Gateway` component. Required for handling traffic from
    ### external sources
    ###
    - httpbin-gateway
    ### Special label, enables this virtual service routes to work with requests
    ### from Kubernetes pods (in-cluster communication not via gateways)
    ###
    - mesh
  http:
    - route:
        - destination:
            host: httpbin
            port:
              number: 80
          weight: 100
      mirror:
        host: some.external.service.tld # mirroring destination address
        port:
          number: 8445 # mirroring destination port
---
### For handling external requests
###
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: httpbin-gateway
spec:
  selector:
    istio: ingress
    app: istio-ingress
  servers:
  - port:
      number: 80
      name: http
      protocol: HTTP
    hosts:
    - "httpbin.local"
```

## Traefik

The following configuration example is based on the [`dynamic configuration file`](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/reference/dynamic-configuration/file/) approach. The Traefik web server also supports other configuration modes, and you can easily adjust the provided one to any of them as they have a similar structure.

```yaml
### Dynamic configuration file
### Note: entrypoints are described in static configuration file
http:
  services:
    ### This is how to map original and wallarm `services`.
    ### In further `routers` configuration (see below), please 
    ### use the name of this service (`with_mirroring`).
    ###
    with_mirroring:
      mirroring:
        service: "httpbin"
        mirrors:
          - name: "wallarm"
            percent: 100

    ### The `service` to mirror traffic to - the endpoint
    ### that should receive the requests mirrored (copied)
    ### from the original `service`.
    ###
    wallarm:
      loadBalancer:
        servers:
          - url: "http://wallarm:8445"

    ### Original `service`. This service should receive the
    ### original traffic.
    ###
    httpbin:
      loadBalancer:
        servers:
          - url: "http://httpbin:80/"

  routers:
    ### The router name must be the same as the `service` name
    ### for the traffic mirroring to work (with_mirroring).
    ###
    with_mirroring:
      entryPoints:
        - "web"
      rule: "Host(`mirrored.example.com`)"
      service: "with_mirroring"

    ### The router for the original traffic.
    ###
    just_to_original:
      entryPoints:
        - "web"
      rule: "Host(`original.example.local`)"
      service: "httpbin"
```

## Configure Wallarm to analyze mirrored traffic

Wallarm should be provided with the following configuration:
