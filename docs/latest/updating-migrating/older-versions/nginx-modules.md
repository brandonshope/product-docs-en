# Upgrading Wallarm NGINX modules 2.18 or lower

These instructions describe the steps to upgrade the Wallarm NGINX modules 2.18 or lower to version 3.6. Wallarm NGINX modules are the modules installed in accordance with one of the following instructions:

* [NGINX `stable` module](../../waf-installation/nginx/dynamic-module.md)
* [Module for NGINX from CentOS/Debian repositories](../../waf-installation/nginx/dynamic-module-from-distr.md)
* [NGINX Plus module](../../waf-installation/nginx-plus.md)
* [Kong module](../../admin-en/installation-kong-en.md)

--8<-- "../include/waf/upgrade/warning-deprecated-version-upgrade-instructions.md"

## Upgrade procedure

* If filtering node and postanalytics modules are installed on the same server, then follow the instructions below to upgrade all packages.
* If filtering node and postanalytics modules are installed on different servers, **first** upgrade the postanalytics module following these [instructions](separate-postanalytics.md) and then perform the steps below for filtering node modules.

## Step 1: Inform Wallarm technical support that you are upgrading filtering node modules

Inform [Wallarm technical support](mailto:support@wallarm.com) that you are updating filtering node modules up to 3.6 and ask to enable new IP lists logic for your Wallarm account. When new IP lists logic is enabled, please open Wallarm Console and ensure that the section [**IP lists**](../../user-guides/ip-lists/overview.md) is available.

## Step 2: Disable the Active threat verification module (if upgrading node 2.16 or lower)

If upgrading Wallarm node 2.16 or lower, please disable the [Active threat verification](../../about-wallarm-waf/detecting-vulnerabilities.md#active-threat-verification) module in Wallarm Console → **Scanner** → **Settings**.

The module operation can cause [false positives](../../about-wallarm-waf/protecting-against-attacks.md#false-positives) during the upgrade process. Disabling the module minimizes this risk.

## Step 3: Upgrade NGINX to the latest stable version

Update [NGINX](http://nginx.org/en/download.html) / [NGINX Plus](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/releases/) to the latest stable release from the official NGINX repository.

If your infrastructure needs to use a specific version of NGINX, please contact the [Wallarm technical support](mailto:support@wallarm.com) to build the API Security module for a custom version of NGINX.

## Step 4: Add new Wallarm repository

Delete the previous Wallarm repository address and add a repository with a new Wallarm node version package. Please use the commands for the appropriate platform.

**CentOS and Amazon Linux 2.0.2021x and lower**

=== "CloudLinux OS 6.x"
    ```bash
    sudo yum remove wallarm-node-repo
    sudo rpm -i https://repo.wallarm.com/centos/wallarm-node/6/3.6/x86_64/Packages/wallarm-node-repo-1-6.el6.noarch.rpm
    ```
=== "CentOS 7 and Amazon Linux 2.0.2021x and lower"
    ```bash
    sudo yum remove wallarm-node-repo
    sudo rpm -i https://repo.wallarm.com/centos/wallarm-node/7/3.6/x86_64/Packages/wallarm-node-repo-1-6.el7.noarch.rpm
    ```
=== "CentOS 8"
    !!! warning "Support for CentOS 8.x has been deprecated"
        Support for CentOS 8.x [has been deprecated](https://www.centos.org/centos-linux-eol/). You can install the Wallarm node 3.6 on the AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux or Oracle Linux 8.x operating system insted.

        * [Installation instructions for NGINX `stable`](../../waf-installation/nginx/dynamic-module.md)
        * [Installation instructions for NGINX from CentOS/Debian repositories](../../waf-installation/nginx/dynamic-module-from-distr.md)
        * [Installation instructions for NGINX Plus](../../waf-installation/nginx-plus.md)

**Debian and Ubuntu**

1. Open the file with the Wallarm repository address in the installed text editor. In these instructions, **vim** is used.

    ```bash
    sudo vim /etc/apt/sources.list.d/wallarm.list
    ```
2. Comment out or delete the previous repository address.
3. Add a new repository address:

    === "Debian 9.x (stretch)"
        ``` bash
        deb http://repo.wallarm.com/debian/wallarm-node stretch/3.6/
        ```
    === "Debian 9.x (stretch-backports)"
        ```bash
        deb http://repo.wallarm.com/debian/wallarm-node stretch/3.6/
        deb http://repo.wallarm.com/debian/wallarm-node stretch-backports/3.6/
        ```
    === "Debian 10.x (buster)"
        ```bash
        deb http://repo.wallarm.com/debian/wallarm-node buster/3.6/
        ```
    === "Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic)"
        ```bash
        deb http://repo.wallarm.com/ubuntu/wallarm-node bionic/3.6/
        ```
    === "Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal)"
        ```bash
        deb http://repo.wallarm.com/ubuntu/wallarm-node focal/3.6/
        ```

## Step 5: Migrate whitelists and blacklists from the previous Wallarm node version to 3.6

[Migrate](../migrate-ip-lists-to-node-3.md) whitelist and blacklist configuration from previous Wallarm node version to 3.6.

## Step 6: Upgrade Wallarm API Security packages

### Filtering node and postanalytics on the same server

1. Execute the following command to upgrade the filtering node and postanalytics modules:

    === "Debian"
        ```bash
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt dist-upgrade
        ```
    === "Ubuntu"
        ```bash
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt dist-upgrade
        ```
    === "CentOS or Amazon Linux 2.0.2021x and lower"
        ```bash
        sudo yum update
        ```
2. If the package manager asks for confirmation to rewrite the content of the configuration file `/etc/cron.d/wallarm-node-nginx`:

    1. Ensure that the [IP lists migration](#step-4-migrate-whitelists-and-blacklists-from-previous-wallarm-node-version-to-32) is completed.
    2. Confirm the file rewrite by using the option `Y`.

        The package manager would ask for the rewrite confirmation if the file `/etc/cron.d/wallarm-node-nginx` had been [changed in the previous Wallarm node versions](/2.18/admin-en/configure-ip-blocking-nginx-en/). Since IP list logic was changed in Wallarm node 3.x, the `/etc/cron.d/wallarm-node-nginx` content was updated accordingly. For the IP address blacklist to operate correctly, the Wallarm node 3.x should use the updated configuration file.

        By default, the package manager uses the option `N` but the option `Y` is required for the correct IP address blacklist operation in Wallarm node 3.x.

### Filtering node and postanalytics on different servers

!!! warning "Sequence of steps to upgrade the filtering node and postanalytics modules"
    If the filtering node and postanalytics modules are installed on different servers, then it is required to upgrade the postanalytics packages before updating the filtering node packages.

1. Upgrade postanalytics packages following these [instructions](separate-postanalytics.md).
2. Upgrade Wallarm node packages:

    === "Debian"
        ```bash
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt dist-upgrade
        ```
    === "Ubuntu"
        ```bash
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt dist-upgrade
        ```
    === "CentOS or Amazon Linux 2.0.2021x and lower"
        ```bash
        sudo yum update
        ```
3. If the package manager asks for confirmation to rewrite the content of the configuration file `/etc/cron.d/wallarm-node-nginx`:

    1. Ensure that the [IP lists migration](#step-4-migrate-whitelists-and-blacklists-from-previous-wallarm-node-version-to-32) is completed.
    2. Confirm the file rewrite by using the option `Y`.

        The package manager would ask for the rewrite confirmation if the file `/etc/cron.d/wallarm-node-nginx` had been [changed in the previous Wallarm node versions](/2.18/admin-en/configure-ip-blocking-nginx-en/). Since IP list logic was changed in Wallarm node 3.x, the `/etc/cron.d/wallarm-node-nginx` content was updated accordingly. For the IP address blacklist to operate correctly, the Wallarm node 3.x should use the updated configuration file.

        By default, the package manager uses the option `N` but the option `Y` is required for the correct IP address blacklist operation in Wallarm node 3.x.

## Step 7: Update the Wallarm blocking page

In new node versions, the Wallarm blocking page has [been changed](what-is-new.md#new-blocking-page). The logo and support email on the page are now empty by default.

If the page `&/usr/share/nginx/html/wallarm_blocked.html` is returned to blocked requests, [copy and customize](../../admin-en/configuration-guides/configure-block-page-and-code.md#customizing-default-blocking-page) its new version.

## Step 8: Rename deprecated NGINX directives

Rename the following NGINX directives if they are explicitly specified in configuration files:

* `wallarm_instance` → [`wallarm_application`](../../admin-en/configure-parameters-en.md#wallarm_application)
* `wallarm_local_trainingset_path` → [`wallarm_custom_ruleset_path`](../../admin-en/configure-parameters-en.md#wallarm_custom_ruleset_path)
* `wallarm_global_trainingset_path` → [`wallarm_protondb_path`](../../admin-en/configure-parameters-en.md#wallarm_protondb_path)

We only changed the names of the directives, their logic remains the same. Directives with former names will be deprecated soon, so you are recommended to rename them before.

## Step 9: Adjust Wallarm node filtration mode settings to changes released in the latest versions

1. Ensure that the expected behavior of settings listed below corresponds to the [changed logic of the `off` and `monitoring` filtration modes](what-is-new.md#filtration-modes):
      * [Directive `wallarm_mode`](../../admin-en/configure-parameters-en.md#wallarm_mode)
      * [General filtration rule configured in Wallarm Console](../../user-guides/settings/general.md)
      * [Low-level filtration rules configured in Wallarm Console](../../user-guides/rules/wallarm-mode-rule.md)
2. If the expected behavior does not correspond to the changed filtration mode logic, please adjust the filtration mode settings to released changes using the [instructions](../../admin-en/configure-wallarm-mode.md).

## Step 10: Restart NGINX

--8<-- "../include/waf/restart-nginx-2.16.md"

## Step 11: Test Wallarm node operation

--8<-- "../include/waf/installation/test-waf-operation.md"

## Step 12: Re-enable the Active threat verification module (if upgrading node 2.16 or lower)

Learn the [recommendation on the Active threat verification module setup](../../admin-en/attack-rechecker-best-practices.md) and re-enable it if required.

After a while, ensure the module operation does not cause false positives. If discovering false positives, please contact the [Wallarm technical support](mailto:support@wallarm.com).

## Settings customization

Wallarm API Security modules are updated to version 3.4. Previous filtering node settings will be applied to the new version automatically. To make additional settings, use the [available directives](../../admin-en/configure-parameters-en.md).
