The Wallarm solution protects websites, APIs, and microservices from OWASP Top 10, bots, and application abuse with no manual rule configuration and ultraâ€‘low false positives.

!!! warning "Unsupported version"
    Wallarm node 4.0 and lower are not supported. We have significantly simplified the node configuration procedure and made attack mitigation even more powerful and usable in the later releases.

    Please learn [what is new in the later versions](/updating-migrating/older-versions/what-is-new/) and plan the upgrade procedure.
